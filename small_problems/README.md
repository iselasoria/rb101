This folder contains all the problems I was unable to do when going through 101 the first time.

#Easy3Q6#
Write a method that returns the exclusive of two arguments. It returns true if exaclty one of its argumentsd is truthy
false, otherwise. We're looig for boolean values.


#Easy2Q8#
Write a method that returns true if the string passed as an argument is a palindrome, false otherwise. A palindrome reads the same forward and backward. For this exercise, case matters as does punctuation and spaces.
