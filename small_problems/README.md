This folder contains all the problems I was unable to do when going through 101 the first time.

#Easy3Q6#
Write a method that returns the exclusive of two arguments. It returns true if exaclty one of its argumentsd is truthy
false, otherwise. We're looig for boolean values.


#Easy2Q8#
Write a method that returns true if the string passed as an argument is a palindrome, false otherwise. A palindrome reads the same forward and backward. For this exercise, case matters as does punctuation and spaces.


#Easy4Q2#
write a method that takes a year as input and returns the century.
The return value should be a string that begins with the century
number, ends with st, nd, rd or th as appropriate for that number.

New centuries begin in years that end with 01. So, the years
1901 - 2000 comprise the 20th century.

#Easy4Q5#
Write a method thats searches for all multiple of 3 and 5 that lie
between 1 and some other number, and then computes the sum of those multiples. For instance, if the supplied number is 20, the result should be 98(3 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 18 + 20). You can assume numbers are greater than 1.

#Easy4Q7#
Write a method that takes a String of digits, and returns the appropriate number as an integer. You may not use any of the methods mentioned above.
