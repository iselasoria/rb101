# write code that has:
# a method that returns the sum of two integers
# a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together
# a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

define method 
  sum = number1 + number 2
returns sum 

define method that takes an array
  iterate through the array
    print each item in the array in the same line through concatenation


define a method that takes an array of integers
iterate through array
next on every other item 
push every other itme (not skipped) into a new array 
return the new array
